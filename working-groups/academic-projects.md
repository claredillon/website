**Status**: Active<br>
**Bottom liner**: Richard Littauer<br>
**How to get involved**:

* Email Richard at richard at sustainoss.org

## Purpose

* To connect universities and other academic research institutions to collaborate on how to approach and work on open source together.

## Goals

* To build an ecosystem map of the space so that we know who is doing relevant work and how to get involved
* To connect people working in universities, both in and outside of OSPOs
* To enable collaboration around shared effort in academia

## Guiding questions

* What does it mean for open source to be part of academia?
* What is the role of OSPOs in academia? What does a post-OSPO world look like?
* How do students, researchers, civil society members, and institutions work together effectively for open source?
* What is the wider role around research software engineers, and how can we support them as part of the open source ecosystem?

## Reports and documents
